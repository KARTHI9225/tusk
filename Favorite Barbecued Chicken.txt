Ingredients:

2 broiler/fryer chickens (3 to 4 pounds each), cut into 8 pieces each
Salt and pepper

BARBECUE SAUCE:

2 tablespoons canola oil
2 small onions, finely chopped
2 cups ketchup
1/4 cup lemon juice
2 tablespoons brown sugar
2 tablespoons water
1 teaspoon ground mustard
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon hot pepper sauce

Directions

Sprinkle chicken pieces with salt and pepper. Grill skin side down, uncovered, on a greased grill rack over medium heat for 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, make barbecue sauce by heating oil over medium heat. Add onion; saute until tender. Stir in remaining sauce ingredients and bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 10 minutes.
Turn chicken; brush with barbecue sauce. Grill 15-25 minutes longer, brushing frequently with sauce, until a thermometer reads 165° when inserted in the breast and 170°-175° in the thigh.
